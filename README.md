# Multiple Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning ( TensorFlow - Keras )

# Requirements

* TensorFlow (Keras)
* Python 3.5 +
* Numpy 
* PIL ( pillow )
* Opencv
* tkinter ( python GUI )

# About Project

* Trained model on MNIST dataset Using CNN.
* Save model training as train_digit_recognizer.py 
* Save model as 'mnist.h5' 
* Using tkinter GUI make a canvas and write digit on it
* Using PIL get a copy of Handwritten Digits on the canvas.
* Also with the help of OpenCV by recognizing contours it can handle multiple digits
* Use saved model 'mnist.h5' to predict saved Handwritten Digit image from canvas
