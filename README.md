# Multiple Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning ( TensorFlow - Keras )

# Requirements

* TensorFlow (Keras)
* Python 3.5 +
* Numpy 
* PIL ( Python Image Library )
* Opencv
* tkinter

# About Project

* Trained model on MNIST dataset Using CNN.
* Saved training as train_digit_recognizer.py 
* Saved model as 'mnist.h5' 
* Used tkinter GUI make a canvas and write digit on it
* Used PIL get a copy of Handwritten Digits on the canvas.
* Also with the help of OpenCV by recognizing contours it can handle multiple digits
* Used saved model 'mnist.h5' to predict saved Handwritten Digit image from canvas
